---

### Phase 3: A/B Testing (Days 5-6)
**Method**: Controlled Experiment with Live Prototype
**Sample Size**: 24 participants (12 per variant)
**Duration**: Beta feature deployment with analytics

#### Experimental Design
**Variant A: Standard Workflow**
- Traditional Create tab entry point
- Manual pitch input required
- Current user experience maintained

**Variant B: Reference-First Workflow**
- Reference tab prominently featured
- Guided onboarding for new feature
- Optional fallback to manual input

#### Randomization Strategy
- **New Users**: 50/50 split based on session ID
- **Existing Users**: Randomly assigned via user ID
- **Cross-over Design**: Users can experience both after initial test

#### Metrics Collection
**Quantitative Metrics:**
```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvents {
  // Reference Tab Engagement
  reference_tab_viewed: { user_id: string, timestamp: Date };
  video_url_submitted: { url: string, user_id: string };
  analysis_completed: { duration_ms: number, confidence: number };
  content_edited: { field: string, changes_count: number };
  content_transferred: { user_id: string, success: boolean };
  
  // Comparative Metrics
  story_creation_started: { entry_point: 'reference' | 'create' };
  story_creation_completed: { total_time_ms: number };
  user_satisfaction_rating: { score: number, entry_point: string };
}
```

**Conversion Funnel:**
1. **Awareness**: Reference tab viewed
2. **Trial**: Video URL submitted
3. **Value**: Analysis completed successfully
4. **Adoption**: Content transferred to Create
5. **Success**: Final story generated

#### Data Collection Dashboard
```
Reference Tab Performance:
- Conversion rate: Tab view → URL submission → Transfer
